        "# Analysis Topics\n",
        "\n",
        "Using these data sets, here are several possible questions to explore:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Gun Ownership vs. Firearm Deaths: How does the rate of gun ownership in different states correlate with the number of deaths due to firearms? Does gun ownership correlate with firearm deaths in the U.S.? Does the pattern hold only in the aggregate or also by state? \n",
        "\n",
        "- Trends in Gun-related Deaths: What are the trends in gun-related deaths at the individual level over time? Use the FiveThirtyEight data to explore trends and patterns, possibly breaking down the data by factors like age, gender, or type of incident (e.g., homicide, suicide, accidental).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Impact of Events on Gun Sales: Can significant events (like mass shootings or political changes) be linked to spikes in gun sales? Use the NYTimes gunsales data to visualize changes over time and correlate these with major national or international events.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Effectiveness of Gun Laws: Analyze the impact of different state firearm laws on gun-related deaths and gun sales. This would involve a comparison between the State Firearm Database and the other datasets on gun deaths and gun ownership. Are gun regulations (e.g. child access prevention laws) associated with lower gun death rates? How about suicides (especially by non-adults)?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Demographic Analysis of Gun Deaths: Who are the victims of gun-related deaths? Using the individual-level data from FiveThirtyEight, analyze the demographics of victims, including age, sex, race, and the circumstances of their deaths (suicide, homicide, accidental).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Time Series Analysis of Gun Sales: How have gun sales changed over time across different states? Use time series visualizations to explore trends in gun sales data from the NYTimes dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Comparative Analysis of State Gun Laws: How do state gun laws vary across the U.S., and have there been significant changes in legislation over time? Use the State Firearm Database to create visualizations that track the evolution of gun laws across different states and time periods.\n",
